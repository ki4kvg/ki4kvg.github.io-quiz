## About my project

As it is small project I decided to initialize styled component in the same file where they used. Their number is small.
Therefore, they do not interfere either visually or practically.
If it was bigger project I would do some folders logic and architecture, and put styled components in separate folders according to project logic, so anybody can ease reuse any component, and it
would be easy to find it even without search.

## Potential enhancements or optimizations

Some kind of achievements could be possible to add to this project as future feature. Like "Finish 5 quizzes without
wrong answers" or "Complete 2 quizzes in "some" category".

### Global rating table
